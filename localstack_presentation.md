# **Is it worth it?**

_‚ö†Ô∏èOPINIONS MY OWN‚ö†Ô∏è_

- Be **careful** with providers
- LocalStack **[almost](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/)** emulates AWS
- Community edition does **not** cover all services
- **[Inconvenience](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/)** of another layer to maintain
